- crude fatality ratio [CFR2] 3.8%

Virulence
- iCOVID-19 is transmitted via droplets and fomites during close unprotected contactbetween an infector and infectee.
- Airborne spread has Not been reported for COVID-19 and it is not believed to be a major driver of transmission based on available evidenceAs COVID-19
- there is no known pre-existing immunity in humans. Based on the epidemiologic characteristics observed so farin China, everyone is assumed to be susceptible

WHO Recomendations
1. Recognize that COVID-19 is a new and concerning disease,but that outbreaks can managed with the right response and that the vast majority of infected people will recover;
2.Begin now to adopt and rigorously practice the most important preventive measures for COVID-19 by frequent hand washing and always covering your mouth and nose when sneezing or coughing;
3.Continually update yourself on COVID-19and its signs and symptoms (i.e. fever and dry cough), because the strategies and response activities will constantly improve as new information on this disease is accumulating every day; and
4.Be prepared to actively support a response to COVID-19 in a variety of ways, including the adoption of more stringent ‘social distancing’ practices and helping the high-risk elderly population.

Disinfection Solutions
- it can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection procedures with
- 62–71% ethanol,
- 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or
- 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within
- 1 minute.
- *Other biocidal agents such as 0.05–0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate are less effective.

Prevelance on Inanimate Surfaces
- The analysis of 22 studies reveals that human coronaviruses such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus or endemic human coronaviruses (HCoV) can persist on inanimate surfaces like metal, glass or plastic for up to
- 9 days
